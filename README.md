# books-website
Dear Spaceptic,

This conatins all the files you needed along with the backend.The main.js file is the main backend file the views folder consists of all of the frontend.The models folder contains of all of the mongoose models that are used.The package.json and package_lock.json contains of projects details (dont delete them).

For the ejs files you just think that it is as same as HTML and nothing more.

To Edit those files on your computer you need to install node.js and type "npm intall" in the terminal which will automatically install all node modules needed.

Last but not the least for running and testing the website you need to type "nodemon .\main.js" or "nodemon ..\main.js" in the terminal and after making any changes when you'll save the work it will automatically commit all changes so no need to restart the website.
